      The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball
      league in North America. The league is composed of 30 teams (29 in the
      United States and 1 in Canada) and is one of the four major professional
      sports leagues in the United States and Canada. It is the premier men's
      professional basketball league in the world.[3] The league was founded in
      New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America
      (BAA).[1] It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on
      August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball
      League (NBL).[4] The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with
      each team playing 82 games. The league's playoff tournament extends into
      June. As of 2020, NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by
      average annual salary per player.[5][6][7]
